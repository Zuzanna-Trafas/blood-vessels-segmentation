# Blood vessels segmentation
A project for retinal blood vessel segmentation using 3 approaches:  image processing techniques, machine learning with LightGBM and deep learning with convolutional neural network (U-net)

We used HRF Image Database (https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/)
